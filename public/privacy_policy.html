    <h1>Privacy Policy for Find A Surveyor</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 2, 2025</p>
    <p>Thank you for using Find A Surveyor. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information in a few different ways to provide and improve our service:</p>

    <h3>1. Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you choose to create an account to save favorites or claim a profile, we may collect your name, email address, and phone number. This is handled securely through Firebase Authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Favorites Data:</strong> When you mark a surveyor as a favorite, that information is stored locally on your device in a private database.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Information We Collect Automatically:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, we access your device's location (latitude and longitude) for the sole purpose of providing the "Near Me" feature to show you nearby surveyors. We do not store your location history. You can revoke this permission at any time in your device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymous data about how you interact with our app. This includes which features are most popular, which filters are used, and general usage patterns. This helps us understand what's working and how to improve the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Data:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect reports if the app crashes. This data is anonymous and helps us find and fix bugs to improve the app's stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Information from Public Sources:</h3>
    <p>The core directory information about surveyors (name, SLA number, address, departments) is sourced from the publicly available list provided by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the core functionality of the app, including search, filtering, and the "Near Me" feature.</li>
        <li>To allow you to create and manage your account securely.</li>
        <li>To enable you to save your favorite surveyors for offline access.</li>
        <li>To analyze usage trends and fix crashes to enhance the user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We only share information with the following third-party services that are essential for the app to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> We use Firebase for our backend services, including Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Storage, Analytics, and Crashlytics. Your use of our app is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Maps Platform:</strong> To display maps and geocode addresses, we use the Google Maps Platform. This usage is covered by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your data. We leverage the robust security infrastructure of Google Firebase to store and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You have control over your information. You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device's settings. If you have created an account, you have the right to request the deletion of your account and associated data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
